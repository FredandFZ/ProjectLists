# ProjectLists
This repository contains the projects I have participated in.

## Elavate
The **Elavate** folder contains a global volunteer and community collaboration platform designed to help them work together more efficiently on public welfare projects. In this project, I was responsible for all the front-end development, using the **Vue 3** framework.

**Library System** is a small project I developed independently, where I completed both the front-end and back-end. The front-end was built with **Vue 3 + Bootstrap**, while the back-end was implemented with **Django + DRF**.
